Bank Program

Simple Bank Account System
This is a Java program that simulates a simple bank account system. It allows users to create a bank account, check their balance, deposit funds, withdraw funds, and view their previous transactions. 
The program is designed to run in the console, providing a text-based interface for users to interact with.

Features:

- Create a Bank Account: Users can create a bank account by providing their full name and a customer ID. The customer ID is hardcoded for demonstration purposes in this example.
- Check Balance: Users can check their account balance, which displays the current balance in the account.
- Deposit Funds: Users can deposit funds into their account by specifying the amount they want to deposit. The program will update the account balance accordingly.
- Withdraw Funds: Users can withdraw funds from their account by specifying the amount they want to withdraw. If there are sufficient funds in the account, the withdrawal is processed; otherwise, it displays an "Insufficient funds" message.
- View Previous Transactions: Users can view their previous transactions, including deposits and withdrawals. If there were no transactions, it will display a "No transaction occurred" message.
- Exit: Users can exit the program when they are done with their banking activities.

How to Use:
- Run the program in a Java development environment or from the command line.
- Enter your full name when prompted.
- enter the predefined customer ID (34324332) to access the account functionalities. You will be prompted to try again if the name and customer ID do not match the predefined values ("Shpetim Gashi" and 34324332).
- Once successfully authenticated, you can choose from various options in the menu, such as checking balance, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, viewing previous transactions, or exiting the program.
- You can follow the on-screen instructions to perform your banking activities.
- When finished, choose the "Exit" option to close the program


Notes:
- The program does not include advanced security features or account persistence. It is meant for educational purposes and should not be used in a production environment.
- Feel free to extend and modify the program to add more features or improve its functionality.
